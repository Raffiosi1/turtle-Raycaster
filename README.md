Welcome to turtle-3D,
this is where I store my 3D game progress in Python.
You are welcome to check it out!
PS I know it's not using turtle anymore

Raycaster:
A top down game where the player sends out raycasts.

3D-game:
First iteration of a 3D* game written in python

3D-game v2
second iteration of a 3D* game written in python, with textures and now made in pygame

*it's not actually 3D, just a illusion
